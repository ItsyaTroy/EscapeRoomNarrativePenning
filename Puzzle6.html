<!-- Opening Narrative for the sixth and final puzzle -->
<h1 id="narrative">Sudoku? </h1>
<p id="narrative"> The aliens find a translator and begin speaking your language. They tell you they appreciate the help and kindness you've shown them so far. They also appreciate you not compromising their location, and that the crash was a complete accident. Based on your success in previous puzzles, they ask if you can provide them assistance in coordinating a path that they can use to escape; A number that will tell the ship where to fly. They explain that they must have gotten the number wrong as this number was the reason that they crashed in the first place. They explain that the number made from the bottom middle row in the grid will let them leave and go home (the row with the 8 in the middle left to right). This grid... looks like a game of Sudoku! if you can solve this, then they can go home! </p>
