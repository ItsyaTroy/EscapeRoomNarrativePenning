<!-- Opening Narrative for the third puzzle -->
<h1 id="narrativetitle">Temperature Tempo 2: The numbers... what do they mean!?</h1>
<p id="narrative">after figuring out what plant is the one you need; you find that the recommended temperature written beneath it is written in more symbols. You're in luck this time! It seems whoever left those notes previously also had some notes left here. However, it seems that they were also trying to get through this door, yet it seems that this is where they gave up and left. They left some math under it though with a few great hints! You need to figure out what temperature you need! </p>
