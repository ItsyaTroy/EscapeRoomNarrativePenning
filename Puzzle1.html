<!-- Opening Narrative for the first puzzle -->
<h1 id="narrative">Decipher this ancient or unknown language. </h1>
<p id="narrative">As you enter the ship, the door behind you closes automatically. You look around the room realize that there isn't much room here at all. In fact, this looks more like a connecting room or some kind of lobby room. You wonder if this room is used as some kind of cleansing room for the aliens to keep unknown germs out of the ship. The only thing IN the room is a door right in front of you, as well as some beat up notebook. You investigate the door first and notice that there are some foreign symbols on a keypad as well as a keyboard like thing stickout out on the other side. You look in the notebook and notice some english. Whoever was here before you must have been trying to translate the symbols. It looks like he succeded, but either left his notes here, or worse. With not much options, you decide that translating the word and opening the door is probably your best bet.</p>
