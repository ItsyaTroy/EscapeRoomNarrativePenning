<!-- Opening Narrative for the second puzzle -->
<h1 id="narrative">Temperature Tempo! </h1>
<p id="narrative">As you get the passcode correct, the door opens itself into the next room. It's a strange looking room full of flowers and vegetation. All of the specimens look alien to you; You admire all the different colors. Eventually you've had your fill of all the craziness and decide to go to the next room. Suddenly the door slams shut and a red light begins to beep! A message comes up in the alien language. After taking time to translate it, you figure out what it says: it's telling you to set the temperature for the Plunk to a certain number. The only problem is you don't know the number and you don't know which plant is which! You see there is an encyclopedia full of each plant and its name. You need to figure out which is which and then go from there.</p>
