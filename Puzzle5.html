<!-- Opening Narrative for the fifth puzzle -->
<h1 id="narrative">Binary Bonanza</h1>
<p id="narrative">After translating the message, you realize that they're telling you to go right. What it brings you towards looks to be a binary puzzle. This one looks a bit strange, but they all have at this point. You approach a box that is locked by a screen with unusual numbers. It looks to be damaged with different flickering numbers. Some of them still seem to be intact; an 8 digit code of sorts that reads: __35__9_. The blank spaces are flashing what looks to be binary? You remember learning a bit of binary in Mrs. Brooks class back at Coastal Carolina! Based on that knowledge, you get to work (reminder that 1= 0, 2 = 1, 3= 10, 4 = 11, 5 = 100, etc.) </p>
