<!-- Opening Narrative for the escape room -->
<h1 id="narrative">What're we looking at?</h1>
<p id="narrative">You're chilling home alone on a Saturday while everyone else is out. You’re watching TV and having a relatively worry-free weekend. Suddenly everything starts to shake. Is this an earthquake? Why is the shacking getting worse every second? You think to yourself that it can’t get any worse, but then hear a giant explosion come from your backyard. You decide to check it out and see a foreign looking aircraft that looks to have crashed in your backyard. Luckily it didn't hurt anyone as you live in the countryside, away from civilization. Before you can decide on what to do you see what appears to be a door shoot open off the side. Aliens? or simply a nasty prank gone horribly wrong? Should you call for help and leave it alone or let your curiosity answer for you? Find out by exploring the devastation in your backyard!  Now ask yourself: Is this an alien spaceship? Could you possibly be the first person to discover aliens? What could possibly be inside? Play this escape room now to try and find some answers! from deciphering alien language to inspecting weird rooms and technology, to... playing sudoku? The escape room where you do the opposite of escape! </p>
