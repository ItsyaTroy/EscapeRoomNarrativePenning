<!-- Opening Narrative for the fourth puzzle -->
<h1 id="narrative">Morse Code mishap</h1>
<p id="narrative">As you continue to explore the ship, you come across a door that looks a bit bigger than the rest, Its surrounded by glass. You peek through when suddenly an alien face greets you! You both stare at each other for a moment before the alien walks back and start to talk to another next to it. They go back and forth for a good minute before an intercom looking device drops down from the ceiling. It plays a series of beeps, and then after a moment of silence, begins again. You remember a military friend of yours once explaining that morse code is based off beeps and is a universal type of language often used in military. Remembering this you pull up a chart on your phone and wait for the message to repeat. Once it does you get to work. </p>
